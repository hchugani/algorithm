    Let's go back to the interview context. For x \ge 2xâ‰¥2 the square root is always smaller than x / 2x/2 and larger than 0 : 0 < a < x / 20<a<x/2.
    Since aa is an integer, the problem goes down to the iteration over the sorted set of integer numbers. Here the binary search enters the scene

    Algorithm

    If x < 2, return x.

    Set the left boundary to 2, and the right boundary to x / 2.

    While left <= right:

    Take num = (left + right) / 2 as a guess. Compute num * num and compare it with x:

    If num * num > x, move the right boundary right = pivot -1

    Else, if num * num < x, move the left boundary left = pivot + 1

    Otherwise num * num == x, the integer square root is here, let's return it

    Return right
